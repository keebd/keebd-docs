* Kailh Red – Kailh’s linear switch is nearly identical to Cherry’s offering. The main difference is that this switch features a slightly heavier actuation force – at 0.50 N.
* Kailh Black – These linear switches are heavier than the Kailh Red switches with a 0.60 N actuation force.
* Kailh Speed Silver – Speed Silver switches are Kailh’s answer to the Cherry MX Speed switches. They feature a similar actuation force at 0.45 N but with a slightly longer actuation distance – at 1.3mm compared to Cherry MX Speed’s 1.2mm.
* Kailh Brown – Kailh’s tactile offering features a similar actuation force to their red switches – at 0.50 N.
* Kailh Blue – Kailh’s Blue switches are both tactile and clicky and require an actuation force of 0.60N to register each key’s clicking sound.
* Kailh Speed Bronze – These are the tactile equivalent to the Kailh Speed Silver. The switches feature the same actuation distance and force but with a more tactile and clicky flavour.
* Kailh Speed Copper – This switch is the exact same switch as the Kailh Speed Bronze minus the clicky feature.

Here’s a chart of all the mechanical keyboard switches from Kailh.
