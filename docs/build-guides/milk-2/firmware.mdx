# Firmware

## Precompiled Firmware
Ready to use firmware for the various controllers we sell can be downloaded easily from

[KEEBD Firmware](https://docs.keebd.com/firmware)

## Build Firmware
Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

```bash
make spaceman/2_milk:default
```
or
```bash
qmk compile -kb spaceman/2_milk -km default
```
For Pro Micro ATMega Controllers use [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox) to flash the firmware on the Pro Micro.  

For Pro Micro RP2040 Controllers convert the firmware using
```bash
qmk compile -kb spaceman/2_milk -km default -e CONVERT_TO=helios
```

Before connect RST and GND pins with a paper clip or tweezers, to bring the Pro Micro into the Bootloader Mode.


See the [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools) and the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_make_guide) for more information.
