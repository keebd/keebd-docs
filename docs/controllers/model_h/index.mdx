description: Drop in Model M controller upgrade with QMK and USB support
---

# Model H
This conversion kit allows you to replace your IBM Model M's original internal controller board with a modern USB board. This aims to match the footprint of the original controller and plugs into the original keyboard matrix, but exposes a USB port through the original SDL connector.

Thanks to QMK, the keyboard is fully programmable. It ships with a DFU-style bootloader, which can be programmed over USB.

## Features
* Non-destructive upgrade - just swap the boards
* Native USB (with type B connector), no adapter required
* Doesn't require original controller
* STM32 ARM Processor @ 72MHz with 64kb flash
* Remappable keys (using QMK configurator)
* Uses open source QMK firmare
* Open source hardware
* Reprogrammable through USB or ARM SWD
* Lower power (50 mA typical)
* Genuine "TE Connectivity Trio-mate" connectors, as used on the original Model M

## Compatibility
The Model H comes in two variants to match different internal connectors. Please check to make sure you order the right one.
