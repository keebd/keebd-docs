## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This page addresses frequently asked questions regarding the nice!nano Keyboard Controller.

### General Questions

*   **What is the nice!nano Controller?**

    The nice!nano is a wireless-first keyboard controller based on the nRF52840 microcontroller. It's designed with a Pro Micro footprint, making it a popular choice for building wireless custom mechanical keyboards, especially split keyboards. It primarily uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for communication.

*   **What firmware is compatible with the nice!nano Controller?**

    The nice!nano is primarily designed for and best supported by **ZMK Firmware**. While QMK has support for the nRF52840, ZMK offers more comprehensive wireless features and power management tailored for devices like the nice!nano.

### Firmware and Flashing (ZMK)

*   **How do I flash ZMK firmware onto my nice!nano Controller?**

    Follow these general steps (refer to the [official ZMK documentation](https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup) for the most up-to-date and detailed instructions):

    1.  **Obtain your `.uf2` firmware file:** You'll typically build this using ZMK's build system (e.g., GitHub Actions) configured for your specific keyboard shield and keymap.
    2.  Unplug the nice!nano from your computer and ensure any connected battery is also disconnected, especially if it's the first time flashing or you're encountering issues.
    3.  Plug the nice!nano into your computer using a USB-C cable.
    4.  Locate the RESET button on the nice!nano. It's a small physical button.
    5.  Quickly double-press the RESET button.
    6.  A new drive, typically named "NICENANO" or "FTHR840BOOT" (or similar), should appear on your computer.
    7.  Copy your `.uf2` firmware file to this drive.
    8.  The nice!nano will automatically eject the drive and reboot with the new firmware.
    9.  After flashing, you can reconnect the battery if you disconnected it.

    If you're having trouble entering the bootloader, you can also check our general Entering the Bootloader troubleshooting page, keeping in mind the method for nice!nano is the double-reset.

*   **The "NICENANO" drive doesn't appear when I try to flash.**

    *   Ensure you are double-pressing the RESET button quickly and firmly.
    *   Try a different USB-C data cable (some cables are power-only).
    *   Try a different USB port on your computer.
    *   If a battery is connected, try disconnecting it and flashing with USB power only.
    *   Ensure the nice!nano is properly seated if it's in a socket.

*   **My keyboard doesn't work after flashing ZMK firmware.**

    *   Ensure you're using the correct `.uf2` file built for your specific keyboard shield (e.g., `yourshield_left.uf2`, `yourshield_right.uf2`).
    *   Double-check your ZMK configuration files (e.g., `<shield_name>.keymap`, `<shield_name>.conf`, `<shield_name>.overlay`).
    *   Try re-flashing the firmware.
    *   The firmware file may be corrupt. Try rebuilding it.
    *   Consult the ZMK documentation and community for troubleshooting specific ZMK issues.

### Hardware & Wireless Issues

*   **My nice!nano isn't being recognized by my computer (not even for flashing).**

    *   Follow the troubleshooting steps for the "NICENANO drive doesn't appear" issue above.
    *   Check for any physical damage to the USB-C port or the controller.
    *   If socketed, ensure all pins are making good contact.

*   **One or more keys on my keyboard aren't working.**

    *   This is often a hardware issue related to the keyboard PCB, switch soldering, or switch itself, rather than the nice!nano directly.
    *   Check the soldering of the switches to the PCB.
    *   Ensure the switches are properly inserted into hot-swap sockets (if used).
    *   The switch may be faulty. Try replacing it.
    *   Verify your ZMK keymap is correctly defining the problematic keys.

*   **My wireless keyboard (or one half of a split) isn't pairing or connecting.**

    *   Ensure the battery is charged and properly connected (correct polarity!).
    *   Follow ZMK's Bluetooth pairing and bonding reset procedures.
    *   Check for interference from other wireless devices or metal objects.
    *   For split keyboards, ensure both halves are flashed with their respective `_left` and `_right` firmware and that they are trying to pair with each other correctly. See ZMK split keyboard documentation.

*   **My battery drains very quickly.**

    *   Ensure you're using a LiPo battery with the correct voltage (typically 3.7V).
    *   Check for any shorts on the PCB or controller.
    *   Verify your ZMK configuration has appropriate power-saving features enabled.
    *   The battery itself might be old or faulty.

### Layout and Configuration (ZMK)

*   **How do I configure my keyboard layout with ZMK?**

    Layout configuration in ZMK is done by defining a keymap file (e.g., `your_keyboard.keymap`) within your ZMK user configuration repository. Refer to the ZMK Keymap documentation for detailed instructions.

*   **Where can I find pre-made ZMK configurations or keymaps?**

    Many keyboard designers and communities share their ZMK configurations on GitHub. Search for your specific keyboard PCB or shield name along with "ZMK config."

### Community and Support

*   **Where can I get more help with my nice!nano Controller and ZMK?**

    *   The official **ZMK Discord server** is the best place for ZMK-specific questions and community support.
    *   Check the documentation for your specific keyboard PCB or kit.
    *   Online keyboard communities like Reddit (r/olkb, r/ergomechkeyboards) or forums.

This FAQ is a starting point. Always refer to the official ZMK documentation and your keyboard's specific documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
