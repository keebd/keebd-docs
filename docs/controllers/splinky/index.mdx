## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This page addresses frequently asked questions regarding the Splinky RP2040 Controller.

### General Questions

*   **What is the Splinky Controller?**

    The Splinky is a keyboard controller based on the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller, designed with a Pro Micro footprint. It's a versatile option for custom keyboards, offering a good balance of performance and ease of use.

*   **What firmware is compatible with the Splinky?**

    The Splinky supports various firmware options, including:
    *   **QMK Firmware:** Popular for its extensive features and customization.
    *   **KMK Firmware:** Python-based firmware, often easier for beginners.
    *   **CircuitPython:** Allows for easy Python-based development.

### Firmware and Flashing

*   **How do I flash firmware onto my Splinky Controller?**

    The Splinky uses the UF2 bootloader, making flashing straightforward:

    1.  **Obtain your `.uf2` firmware file:** Build or download this for your specific keyboard and chosen firmware (QMK, KMK, etc.).
    2.  Unplug the Splinky from your computer.
    3.  Plug the Splinky (or the keyboard it's in) into your computer using a USB-C data cable.
    4.  Locate the RESET button on the Splinky. Some versions might have a BOOTSEL button instead or require shorting specific pins.
    5.  Quickly double-press the RESET button. If it has a BOOTSEL button, hold BOOTSEL while plugging in or while pressing RESET.
    6.  A new drive, typically named "RPI-RP2", should appear on your computer.
    7.  Copy your `.uf2` firmware file to this "RPI-RP2" drive.
    8.  The Splinky will automatically eject the drive and reboot with the new firmware.

    For detailed instructions, refer to the general guide on Flashing RP2040 Controllers.
    If you have trouble, see the Entering the Bootloader troubleshooting page.

*   **The "RPI-RP2" drive doesn't appear when I try to flash.**

    *   Ensure you are correctly triggering the bootloader mode (double-press RESET or using BOOTSEL).
    *   Try a different USB-C data cable (some are power-only) and a different USB port.
    *   Make sure the Splinky is properly seated if it's in a socket.

*   **My keyboard doesn't work after flashing.**

    *   Verify you're using the correct `.uf2` file for your keyboard layout and chosen firmware.
    *   Try re-flashing, ensuring the UF2 file fully copies.
    *   The firmware file might be corrupt or incompatible. Download a fresh copy or rebuild it.

### Hardware Issues

*   **My Splinky isn't recognized by my computer.**

    *   Follow the steps for the "RPI-RP2 drive doesn't appear" issue.
    *   Check for physical damage to the USB-C port or controller.
    *   If socketed, ensure all pins are making good contact.

*   **One or more keys on my keyboard aren't working.**

    *   This is often a hardware issue (soldering, switch, diode) or a firmware configuration error (pin assignments in QMK/KMK).
    *   Check solder joints for switches, diodes, and the controller.
    *   Ensure diodes are oriented correctly.
    *   Verify pin definitions in your firmware.

### Layout and Configuration

*   **How do I configure my keyboard layout?**

    This depends on your chosen firmware:
    *   **QMK:** Edit `keymap.c` and `config.h` files.
    *   **KMK/CircuitPython:** Edit Python files (e.g., `code.py` or `main.py`).
    Refer to the documentation for your specific firmware.

### Community and Support

*   **Where can I get more help with my Splinky Controller?**

    *   The **QMK or KMK Discord servers** (depending on your firmware).
    *   Communities related to RP2040 microcontrollers.

Always refer to the official documentation for your chosen firmware and any specific guides for the Splinky variant you have.
