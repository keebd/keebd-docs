## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This page addresses frequently asked questions regarding the Svlinky RP2040 Controller.

### General Questions

*   **What is the Svlinky Controller?**

    The Svlinky is a compact keyboard controller featuring the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller and designed with a Pro Micro footprint. It's a popular choice for custom keyboard builds due to the RP2040's capabilities and the ease of UF2 flashing.

*   **What firmware is compatible with the Svlinky?**

    The Svlinky is compatible with firmware that supports the RP2040, including:
    *   **QMK Firmware:** Offers extensive customization and features.
    *   **KMK Firmware:** A Python-based firmware, often considered more beginner-friendly.
    *   **CircuitPython:** Enables keyboard development using Python.

### Firmware and Flashing

*   **How do I flash firmware onto my Svlinky Controller?**

    The Svlinky uses the UF2 bootloader:

    1.  **Get your `.uf2` firmware file:** This file should be built or downloaded for your specific keyboard layout and the firmware you intend to use (QMK, KMK, etc.).
    2.  Unplug the Svlinky from your computer.
    3.  Plug the Svlinky (or the keyboard it's installed in) into your computer with a USB-C data cable.
    4.  Locate the RESET button on the Svlinky. Some designs might also have a BOOTSEL button.
    5.  Quickly double-press the RESET button. If a BOOTSEL button is present, you might need to hold it while plugging in or while pressing RESET.
    6.  A new disk drive, usually named "RPI-RP2", will appear on your computer.
    7.  Drag and drop your `.uf2` firmware file onto this "RPI-RP2" drive.
    8.  The Svlinky will automatically eject the drive and restart with the new firmware.

    For more details, see the general guide on Flashing RP2040 Controllers.
    If you encounter issues, consult the Entering the Bootloader troubleshooting page.

*   **The "RPI-RP2" drive is not appearing.**

    *   Ensure you're correctly activating the bootloader (double-press RESET or using BOOTSEL as per your Svlinky's design).
    *   Use a different USB-C data cable (some cables are for charging only) and try another USB port.
    *   If the Svlinky is socketed, check that it's seated correctly.

*   **My keyboard isn't working after flashing.**

    *   Confirm you have the correct `.uf2` file for your keyboard model and firmware type.
    *   Try re-flashing, ensuring the file transfer completes without errors.
    *   The firmware file could be corrupted; try downloading or rebuilding it.

### Hardware Issues

*   **My Svlinky is not detected by the computer.**

    *   Follow the troubleshooting steps for the "RPI-RP2 drive not appearing."
    *   Inspect the USB-C port and the controller for any physical damage.
    *   If socketed, ensure all pins have a good connection.

*   **Specific keys are not working.**

    *   This is commonly a hardware problem (e.g., soldering of switches/diodes, faulty switch) or an error in the firmware's pin configuration.
    *   Review your soldering work, especially for switches and diodes (check orientation).
    *   Verify the pin assignments in your QMK or KMK firmware configuration.

### Layout and Configuration

*   **How do I set up my keyboard layout?**

    This process varies by firmware:
    *   **QMK:** Modify `keymap.c` and potentially `config.h` within your QMK keyboard directory.
    *   **KMK/CircuitPython:** Edit the main Python script (e.g., `code.py`).
    Consult the documentation for your chosen firmware.

### Community and Support

*   **Where can I find help for my Svlinky Controller?**

    *   Relevant Discord servers (QMK, KMK, or specific keyboard communities).
    *   Online forums and communities for RP2040-based projects.

Always check for any specific documentation or guides provided for the version of the Svlinky you are using.
