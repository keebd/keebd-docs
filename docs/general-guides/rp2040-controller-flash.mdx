# Flashing RP2040 Controllers

This guide outlines how to flash new firmware onto keyboard controllers based on the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller, such as the Helios. This process generally involves putting the controller into a special "UF2 bootloader" mode and then copying the firmware file onto it.

## Prerequisites

*   **RP2040-based keyboard controller:** (e.g., Helios, or any other using the RP2040)
*   **USB-C cable:**  For connecting the controller to your computer.
*   **Firmware file (.uf2):** The compiled firmware you want to flash.  This could be a QMK, ZMK, KMK, or other compatible firmware.
*   **A computer:** Running Windows, macOS, or Linux.

## Putting the Controller into UF2 Bootloader Mode

The RP2040 enters UF2 bootloader mode either through a button press or by shorting specific pins during power-up.  The method varies depending on the specific board.  **Consult your board's documentation for the correct method!**

Here are common methods:

*   **Button Press Method #1:**
    1.  Plug the keyboard controller into your computer.
    2.  Locate the RESET button on the controller or keyboard.  This button is usually small and recessed.
    3.  Double press the RESET button in quick succession.

*   **Button Press Method #2:**
    1.  Unplug the keyboard controller from your computer.
    2.  Locate the BOOTSEL button on the controller.  This button is usually small and recessed.
    3.  Press and hold the BOOTSEL button.
    4.  While holding the BOOTSEL button, plug the keyboard controller into your computer.
    5.  Continue holding the BOOTSEL button for a few seconds after plugging it in.
    6.  Release the BOOTSEL button.

*   **Shorting Pins Method:** *USE WITH CAUTION, CONSULT YOUR BOARD'S DOCUMENTATION FIRST!*
    1.  Unplug the keyboard controller from your computer.
    2.  Locate the pins designated for entering bootloader mode (usually labeled BOOT or similar in the board documentation).
    3.  Using a wire or tweezers, short these two pins together.
    4.  While shorting the pins, plug the keyboard controller into your computer.
    5.  Continue shorting the pins for a few seconds after plugging it in.
    6.  Remove the short.

**Successful UF2 Bootloader Entry:**

If successful, a new drive will appear on your computer, usually named "RPI-RP2" or "CIRCUITPY."  This indicates the controller is in bootloader mode and ready to receive the firmware.

If the drive *doesn't* appear, repeat the steps above, making sure you're holding the button or shorting the pins correctly.  Also, double-check your USB cable and try a different USB port.

## Flashing the Firmware

1.  **Locate the .uf2 firmware file** you wish to flash onto the controller.
2.  **Copy the .uf2 file** to the "RPI-RP2" or "CIRCUITPY" drive that appeared when you entered bootloader mode.  Simply drag and drop the file onto the drive.

   *The drive will automatically unmount and disappear.*

3.  **The controller will automatically reboot** and begin running the new firmware.

## Verification

*   **Test the keyboard:**  Connect the keyboard controller to your computer and test all the keys to ensure the firmware was flashed correctly and the keyboard is functioning as expected.
*   **Check in your OS:**  Your operating system should recognize the newly flashed keyboard.

## Troubleshooting

*   **"RPI-RP2" drive doesn't appear:**  Double-check the bootloader entry process.  Try a different USB cable and port.  Consult your board's documentation for specific troubleshooting steps.
*   **Keyboard doesn't work after flashing:** Ensure you're using the correct .uf2 file for your keyboard layout and firmware. Re-flash the firmware.  If problems persist, the firmware may be corrupt or incompatible.
*   **Controller gets stuck in bootloader mode:**  This is rare, but try flashing the firmware again. If the problem persists, consult the RP2040 documentation or the keyboard's specific community for support.

## Important Considerations

*   **Always consult your board's documentation:**  The exact steps for entering bootloader mode can vary significantly between different RP2040-based controllers.  Refer to the official documentation or community resources for your specific board.
*   **Use the correct firmware:**  Make sure you're using the correct .uf2 file for your keyboard layout and firmware. Flashing the wrong firmware can damage your controller.
*   **Static Electricity:**  Be mindful of static electricity when handling electronic components. Ground yourself before touching the controller.

This guide provides general instructions.  Always refer to your specific keyboard controller's documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information. Good luck!
