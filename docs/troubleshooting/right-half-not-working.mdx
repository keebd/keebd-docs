# Right Half Not Working

The first thing to know about the right half is that it does not function without the left half. The left half acts as the central piece that communicates to the device you're typing on. The right half is the peripheral that communicates to the left half. If the left half is not powered on and connected, the right half will not work either.

If you have a working left half and a non-working right half, you likely have a pairing issue between the two halves. You'll want to read the [Split Halves Won't Connect](/troubleshooting/split-halves-wont-connect) guide to troubleshoot this issue.
