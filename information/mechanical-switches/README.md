|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Linear switches are the most straightforward out of all switch types. This type of mechanical keyboard switch offers no feedback or clicking sounds as there is nothing in between the moment you press the key and the actuation point. This allows for a smoother and faster actuation per key press. Linear switches are the preferred mechanical keyboard switches for most gamers. | Clicky switches are the total opposite of linear switches. Not only do they provide tactile feedback between the moment of pressing and the actuation point but they also feature a distinct clicking sound after each key press (hence the name) as compared to the silent nature of linear switches. This type of switch is mainly for those who enjoy the clicking sound when they type. | Tactile switches work similarly to clicky switches as they provide the same tactile feedback or a “bump” when pressed minus the clicking sound. Both tactile switches and clicky switches register a key press without needing the user to press each key all the way down (AKA bottoming out) which is great for typing. |

## Gateron

* Gateron Clear – The lightest linear switch on this list, the Gateron Clear switches feature an actuation force of just 0.35 N.
* Gateron Red – Gateron’s offering works similarly to the other red switches on this list with an actuation force of 0.45 N.
* Gateron Black – A slightly heavier version of the Gateron Red, it is a linear switch with a slightly heavier actuation force at 0.50 N.
* Gateron Blue – These switches feature the tactile and clicky nature of other blue switches on this list. Gateron Blue features an actuation force of 0.55 N.
* Gateron Green – A heavier version of the Gateron Blue switch, this switch features a heavier actuation force than the blue switches – coming in at 0.80 N.
* Gateron Brown – Similar to other brown switches on this list, it is a tactile switch with none of the blue switch’s clicky sound. The switch requires an actuation force of 0.45 N similar to the Gateron Red.

Here’s a chart of all the mechanical keyboard switches from Gateron.

## Cherry MX
![](./cherry-mx-switches.png ':size=700px')

* Cherry MX Red – The most popular choice amongst gamers, Cherry MX Reds are linear switches that are very light to use as they don’t require much force to press – at only 0.45 N.
* Cherry MX Speed – This switch is as light as the Red switches however it comes with a shorter actuation distance of 1.2mm.
* Cherry MX Black – These linear switches require an even heavier actuation force – at 0.60 N.
* Cherry MX Linear Grey – The linear grey switches features the highest actuation force among all switches offered by Cherry – at 0.80 N. This switch comes in either a tactile or linear variant.
* Cherry MX Brown – This tactile switch is the quietest tactile switch offered by Cherry. It features a similar actuation force as the Cherry MX Red – at just 0.45 N.
* Cherry MX Blue – Blue switches often get a bad rep due to their noisy nature, particularly in office or home environments. They work similarly to the brown switches in terms of tactility with an added clicking sound and features a slightly heavier actuation force at 0.60 N.
* Cherry MX Green – These switches are slightly modified versions of the Cherry MX Blue switches and feature a heavier actuation force at 0.80 N.

Here’s a chart of all the mechanical keyboard switches from Cherry.

* Kailh Red – Kailh’s linear switch is nearly identical to Cherry’s offering. The main difference is that this switch features a slightly heavier actuation force – at 0.50 N.
* Kailh Black – These linear switches are heavier than the Kailh Red switches with a 0.60 N actuation force.
* Kailh Speed Silver – Speed Silver switches are Kailh’s answer to the Cherry MX Speed switches. They feature a similar actuation force at 0.45 N but with a slightly longer actuation distance – at 1.3mm compared to Cherry MX Speed’s 1.2mm.
* Kailh Brown – Kailh’s tactile offering features a similar actuation force to their red switches – at 0.50 N.
* Kailh Blue – Kailh’s Blue switches are both tactile and clicky and require an actuation force of 0.60N to register each key’s clicking sound.
* Kailh Speed Bronze – These are the tactile equivalent to the Kailh Speed Silver. The switches feature the same actuation distance and force but with a more tactile and clicky flavour.
* Kailh Speed Copper – This switch is the exact same switch as the Kailh Speed Bronze minus the clicky feature.

## Razer
![](./razer-switches.png ':size=700px')

Razer mechanical keyboard switches are manufactured by the folks at Kailh however, they are designed by Razer themselves. These mechanical keyboard switches are generally developed for gaming above else. Here are all the types of Razer switches available.

* Razer Yellow – Razer’s only linear switch offering features an actuation force of 0.45 N, an actuation distance of 1.2mm and a travel distance of just 3.5mm.
* Razer Green – Razer’s equivalent of a blue switch in that it is both tactile and clicky, the Razer Green switches an actuation force of 0.55 N.
* Razer Orange – This switch is Razer’s answer to brown switches and features an actuation force of 0.55 N, the same as the Razer Greens.
* Razer Opto-Mechanical – Introduced in 2018, these switches are unique as they rely on not only mechanical parts but optical lasers as well. The Razer Opto-Mechanical Switches work by using infrared lasers to register each key press as opposed to the traditional metal contact points used by other mechanical keyboard switches. These switches have an actuation force of 0.45 N and a 1.5mm actuation point. Razer also rates these switches to survive up to 100 million clicks due to less moving parts involved. They are only available on Razer Huntsman keyboards.

Here’s a chart of all the mechanical keyboard switches from Razer.
