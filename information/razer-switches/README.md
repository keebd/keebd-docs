Razer mechanical keyboard switches are manufactured by the folks at Kailh however, they are designed by Razer themselves. These mechanical keyboard switches are generally developed for gaming above else. Here are all the types of Razer switches available.

* Razer Yellow – Razer’s only linear switch offering features an actuation force of 0.45 N, an actuation distance of 1.2mm and a travel distance of just 3.5mm.
* Razer Green – Razer’s equivalent of a blue switch in that it is both tactile and clicky, the Razer Green switches an actuation force of 0.55 N.
* Razer Orange – This switch is Razer’s answer to brown switches and features an actuation force of 0.55 N, the same as the Razer Greens.
* Razer Opto-Mechanical – Introduced in 2018, these switches are unique as they rely on not only mechanical parts but optical lasers as well. The Razer Opto-Mechanical Switches work by using infrared lasers to register each key press as opposed to the traditional metal contact points used by other mechanical keyboard switches. These switches have an actuation force of 0.45 N and a 1.5mm actuation point. Razer also rates these switches to survive up to 100 million clicks due to less moving parts involved. They are only available on Razer Huntsman keyboards.

Here’s a chart of all the mechanical keyboard switches from Razer.
